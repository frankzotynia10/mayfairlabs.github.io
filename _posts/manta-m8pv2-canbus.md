# Katapult and Klipper Setup for Bigtreetech Manta M8p v2

I am always fumbling when flashing a bootloader and firmware to my Manta M8P v2 board. I run a canbus setup and the BTT documentation does not cover it.

## Canbus Board Prep
Place jumper on 120 ohm resistor pins.  These pins can be found just south of the CPU.
